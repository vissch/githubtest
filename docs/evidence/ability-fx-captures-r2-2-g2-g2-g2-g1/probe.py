"""Count the GREEN the player sees in the chlorine bank, bar the rise, and count O240's clouds, not its wash.

WHY. The owner's complaint about the -g2-g2 probe:

    Bar green_rise_m. It reads 0.359, 0.359 and 0.357 and is not in the bars, so a flat sheet passes.
    green_area_frac is 0.0055, 0.0056 and 0.0055 against a 0.005 bar, spread 0.0001. The o240 still is a green
    wash of about 10000 px, not one cloud. Start from lane/show/ability-fx-captures-r2-2-g2-g2's tip. Bar
    outside the spread of three captures of the current build.

Both faults are real. -g2-g2 measured the rise (`green_rise_m` in `measure_t1`) and printed it, but never put it
in `BARS`, so a flat sheet (rise 0 by definition) passed every check. And O240's `o240_green_area_frac` counted
every green pixel in the frame with no `largest_blob` (five calls 40 m apart are five patches, so one blob would
have kept only one call) — which also let a scattered wash of ~10,000 px pass as if it were gas clouds. This probe
keeps -g2-g2's camera maths (`ray`, `ground_distance`, `height_at`, `selftest`), its measure (`greenness`,
`greener`, `green_mask`) and T1's `largest_blob` unchanged, adds the rise to `BARS`, and gives O240 its own
component count instead of one flat area fraction.

THE RISE BAR. `green_rise_m` was already computed in `measure_t1` (the median height of the green mask above the
ground); it is now in `BARS` as `'ge'` against 0.30. The three runs read 0.359/0.359/0.357, spread 0.002 — a round
number well under the floor 0.355, and a flat sheet (rise 0) fails it outright.

THE HEIGHT FLOOR (this probe's one change). The owner:

    The height bar is a ceiling of 0.15 and the sheet at 0.0116 passes it. Give height a floor the sheet fails,
    and reshoot three captures.

He is right: a one-sided bar only refuses a puff that is TOO TALL. The flat pale sheet of the -g2-g2-g2 build read
`green_height_frac` 0.0116 and sailed under the 0.15 ceiling, so the ceiling could never catch "no height at all".
So `BARS` now maps a bar NAME to a (measured key, comparison) pair, and the one measure `green_height_frac` carries
two bars: `green_height_frac` (the owner's ceiling 0.15, `le`, untouched) and `green_height_floor` (`ge`, set from
three captures of the standing-puff build, and below 0.02, so the sheet's own 0.0116 fails it outright). Nothing
else changes: the camera maths, the green mask, `largest_blob`, the O240 clouds, `--pack`, `--calibrate`,
`--selftest` and the spread check are carried from -g2-g2-g2 unchanged.

THE O240 CLOUDS. `components(mask, w, h, dilate)` is `largest_blob`'s connected-component search pulled out so it
returns every component (biggest-first; python's stable `sort` keeps `largest_blob`'s old winner as
`components(...)[0]`, so T1's numbers are unchanged), instead of keeping only the biggest. `measure_o240` takes
the green mask's components, keeps those with at least `CLOUD_MIN_PX` (50) member pixels as `clouds`, and reports
`o240_cloud_count` (how many), `o240_cloud_share` (the green pixels inside those clouds, over all green pixels —
low when the green is scattered, not clouded) and redefines `o240_green_area_frac` as the clouded pixels' share of
the frame, not every green pixel's. `o240_blob_top`, the ten biggest component sizes, is printed as an unbarred
diagnostic.

THE NAMES. Every key says green: `green_low_share`, `green_height_frac`, `green_rise_m`, `green_area_frac`,
`o240_green_area_frac`, `o240_cloud_count`, `o240_cloud_share`. `green_px`, `plate_diff_px`, `blob_px`,
`o240_green_px`, `o240_plate_diff_px` and `o240_blob_top` are printed per run as named diagnostics, barred on
nothing.

THE FRAME GUARD. Before any bar is looked at, the four sidecars' `frame` numbers are read. Two runs sharing a
`gas-t1` frame, or a `gas-o240` frame, are not three captures: the probe prints `same frame: runN and runM both
photographed frame F` and exits 1. `--calibrate` prints the frames and does NOT refuse, so numbers can be read
while the captures are still being shot.

THE BAR. Three runs of the SAME build (`run1`, `run2`, `run3`, each the four GasBankStills captures plus a no-gas
plate) are loaded, at three different frames. For a bar to hold, the three runs must all sit on the pass side AND
the nearest run value to the bar must clear it by at least the three runs' own spread (max - min). A bar sitting
inside the run values, or within one spread of them, is "the build cannot tell a measure from its own noise" and
the probe exits 1 rather than print a false green.

THE LOOK REPORT. `cards/` holds the isolation stills (one hand-packed card per book, gas/smoke/puff, plus a
plate). These are never barred — the gas card is squashed by `CombatFx.GasBankSquash` 0.55 on purpose, so "gas
rise >= smoke rise" would fail by construction and would be a look change nobody asked for here. Instead this
prints, per card, its rise in metres and its relief (stdev of masked luma / its mean), and the gas/smoke ratio of
each.

USAGE
    python probe.py                 bar run1/run2/run3 against each other, print the cards/ look report
    python probe.py --calibrate      print every run's numbers and frames with no bar check and no frame refusal
    python probe.py --selftest       the camera maths against a hand calculation, no images

Exit 0 only when three runs at three different frames are loaded and every bar clears by at least their spread.
Exit 1 with 'three runs needed' if fewer than three run*/ directories hold a full set of stills.
Exit 1 with 'same frame' if two runs photographed the same t1 or o240 frame.
Exit 1 with 'bar inside the noise' if a bar does not clear by the spread.
