"""Count the clouds a player can pick out at the far camera, not every green component.

WHY. The owner's complaint about the -g2-g2-g2 probe:

    At the far camera, count clouds a player can pick out. The pass counts every green component of 50 px, so
    one run reports 20 clouds while the biggest are 4275 and 2310 and the rest are specks under 150 px, and the
    still is a green wash. Reshoot three far captures and bar the count of the large clouds. Start from
    lane/show/ability-fx-captures-r2-2-g2-g2-g2's tip. Bar outside the spread of three captures of the current
    build.

The fault was real: `o240_cloud_count` kept any component of `CLOUD_MIN_PX` (50) or more, so a tail of specks
under 150 px counted alongside the two real clouds (4275, 2310 px), reporting 20 "clouds" for a still with two.
This probe keeps -g2-g2-g2's camera maths (`ray`, `ground_distance`, `height_at`, `selftest`), its measure
(`greenness`, `greener`, `green_mask`), T1's `largest_blob` and `green_rise_m`'s bar unchanged, and gives O240 a
`LARGE_MIN_PX` (300) floor: only components at or above it count as a cloud a player can pick out.

THE RISE BAR. `green_rise_m` is unchanged from -g2-g2-g2: still in `BARS` as `'ge'` against 0.30.

THE LARGE CLOUDS. `components(mask, w, h, dilate)` (unchanged) returns every connected component, biggest-first.
`measure_o240` now splits them two ways: `specks` at `CLOUD_MIN_PX` (50) or more (the old, too-loose floor, kept
only as the diagnostic `o240_speck_count`), and `large` at `LARGE_MIN_PX` (300) or more — a patch big enough to
read as a cloud at the far camera, not a speck in the wash. `o240_large_cloud_count` is how many large components
there are, `o240_large_share` is their pixels over all green pixels, and `o240_green_area_frac` is redefined again
as the large pixels' share of the frame (the wash no longer counts as gas, large or not). `o240_blob_top`, the ten
biggest component sizes, stays an unbarred diagnostic.

THE NAMES. Every key says green: `green_low_share`, `green_height_frac`, `green_rise_m`, `green_area_frac`,
`o240_green_area_frac`, `o240_large_cloud_count`, `o240_large_share`. `green_px`, `plate_diff_px`, `blob_px`,
`o240_green_px`, `o240_plate_diff_px`, `o240_speck_count` and `o240_blob_top` are printed per run as named
diagnostics, barred on nothing.

THE FRAME GUARD. Before any bar is looked at, the four sidecars' `frame` numbers are read. Two runs sharing a
`gas-t1` frame, or a `gas-o240` frame, are not three captures: the probe prints `same frame: runN and runM both
photographed frame F` and exits 1. `--calibrate` prints the frames and does NOT refuse, so numbers can be read
while the captures are still being shot.

THE BAR. Three runs of the SAME build (`run1`, `run2`, `run3`, each the four GasBankStills captures plus a no-gas
plate) are loaded, at three different frames. For a bar to hold, the three runs must all sit on the pass side AND
the nearest run value to the bar must clear it by at least the three runs' own spread (max - min). A bar sitting
inside the run values, or within one spread of them, is "the build cannot tell a measure from its own noise" and
the probe exits 1 rather than print a false green.

THE LOOK REPORT. `cards/` holds the isolation stills (one hand-packed card per book, gas/smoke/puff, plus a
plate). These are never barred — the gas card is squashed by `CombatFx.GasBankSquash` 0.55 on purpose, so "gas
rise >= smoke rise" would fail by construction and would be a look change nobody asked for here. Instead this
prints, per card, its rise in metres and its relief (stdev of masked luma / its mean), and the gas/smoke ratio of
each.

USAGE
    python probe.py                 bar run1/run2/run3 against each other, print the cards/ look report
    python probe.py --calibrate      print every run's numbers and frames with no bar check and no frame refusal
    python probe.py --selftest       the camera maths against a hand calculation, no images

Exit 0 only when three runs at three different frames are loaded and every bar clears by at least their spread.
Exit 1 with 'three runs needed' if fewer than three run*/ directories hold a full set of stills.
Exit 1 with 'same frame' if two runs photographed the same t1 or o240 frame.
Exit 1 with 'bar inside the noise' if a bar does not clear by the spread.
