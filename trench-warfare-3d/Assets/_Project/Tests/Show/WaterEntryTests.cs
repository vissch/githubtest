// Phase: water-entry-splash (2026-10-19, harsh critic: "a man or body dying in water, a flung body landing in
// water, or a dropped item makes no splash; only shells ring the water"). Proves WaterEntry.Throw rings the water
// by mass and nothing on dry ground, with books null throughout: no scene, no GPU.
