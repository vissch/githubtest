// Phase: VFX pass (owner, 2026-09-28; tw3d-board catalogue IN-8, look specs L07 and L08) — part of CombatFx. Behind
// fx.recipes, the gas and smoke fields as the drawn banks: chlorine as GasBank, a low rolling bank standing ON the ground
// (its drawing fills the bottom third of the card, so a man's legs are in it and his head is not), the smoke screen as
// SmokeBank mounds. Per 4 m field cell as before, placed and boiled by a hash of the cell (no random draws); from the
// overview (BankMergeZoom) one card a 2 x 2 block, twice the size, so the field is a blanket with an edge and not
// four times the cards. The field only changes per sim tick, so which cells stand and where their ground is are found
// once a tick (and again when the zoom crosses BankMergeZoom); a frame only boils them.
